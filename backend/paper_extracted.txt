Abstract
The paper discusses the results of a study which explored advanced learners of English
engagement with their mobile devices to develop learning experiences that meet their
needs and goals as foreign language learners. The data were collected from 20 students
by means of a semi -structured interview. The gathered data were subjected to
qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that , on the
one hand , some subjects manifested heightened awareness relating to the
advantageous role of mobile devices in their learning endeavors, their ability to reach
for suitable tools and retrieve necessary information so as to achieve their goals, meet
their needs and adjust their learning of English to their personal learning styles, and on
the other, a rather intuitive and/or ad hoc use of their mobile devices in the classroom.
Keywords: Learner autonomy, mobile devices, advanced EFL learners, learning
English.
1. Introduction
Mobile devices, smartphones and tablet computers in particular, have generated a lot of
interest among researchers in recent years (Byrne & Diem, 2014). This is b ecause the
opportunities these new technologies may offer (e.g. individualized learning, the variety
of mobile apps available, easy access to the internet) and/or the fact tha t they are
increasingly more common among learners make them an important and pot entially
useful addition to formal and informal language learning.
According to Benson (2011), there has always been a connection between educational
technologies and learner autonomy to the extent that they have often been intended for
independent practice. It should be noted, however, that this link and “future enquiry
and practice into technology -mediated learner autonomy will need to be increasingly
aligned to the tools, settings, and activities that are of significance to language learners”
(Reinders & White, 2016, p. 151). Reinders and White (2016) further argue that  as long
as “the potential range of settings, tools, and experiences is now virtually limitless,
individuals need to be increasingly adept at critical adaptive learning in order to benefit
from and contribute effectively to those settings” (p. 151). Beyond doubt, contemporary
language teachers should equip foreign/second language learners with appropriate
knowledge concerning the affordances of mobile devices for language study and they
should prepare them for effective usage of such devices for this purpos e. It is also of
paramount importance, for both researchers and practitioners, to comprehend the link
between the modalities of the language learners' organization of their own learning
experiences and environments and the role mobile technologies, in part icular
smartphones and tablets, play in these contexts.
Taking into consideration the above -mentioned issues, the study reported in this article
investigated ways advanced English language students use their mobile devices (i.e.
smartphones and tablet comp uters) for their language learning. The article commences
with a short overview of relevant literature. Next, the design of the study is described,

namely a research question, description of participants, data collection tools and
analysis. This is followe d by the presentation of the results of the study. The article
closes with discussion and conclusions.
2. Literature review
2.1. Autonomy in foreign/second language learning
The concept of autonomy in second/foreign language learning and teaching has been
the focus of attention for many researchers and practitioners for more than three
decades. According to Benson (2001), the notion of autonomy was introduced and
popularized in 1981 by Henri Holec in his seminal report for the Council of Europe
entitled Autonomy in Foreign Language Learning  in which the researcher defined
autonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own
learning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components
and capacities o n the part of language learners (e.g. self -directed learning). For some
other authors autonomy also involves “a capacity – for detachment, critical reflection,
decision-making, and independent action” (Little, 1991, p. 4) and “the capacity to take
control of one’s own learning” (Benson, 2001, p. 46). As stated by Benson (2011, p.
16), “autonomy is multidimensional and takes many different forms according to the
person, the setting, and multiple contextual and micro -contextual factors” and it is “a
multi-faceted concept that consists of several layers” (Reinders, 2011, p. 48) whose
roots are based in political, societal and educational developments. In addition to this,
work on autonomy emphasizes social dimensions of learner autonomy in view of the
fact that “autonomous learners always do things for themselves, but they may or may
not do things on their own” (Little, 2009, p. 223) and that by means of social
interactions language learners “develop a capacity to analyze, reflect upon and
synthesize information to create new perspectives” (Lee, 2011, p. 88). It should also be
noted that recent research shows that fostering autonomy is no longer predominantly a
matter of individualizing learning through out -of-class initiatives since the dominance of
classroom-based approaches (Benson, 2011). Finally, it has to be added that
researchers, in general, seem to be in agreement with the following claims suggested
by Benson (2011): “(a) language learners naturally tend to take control of their
learning, (b) learners who  lack autonomy are capable of developing it, and (c)
autonomous language learning is more effective than non -autonomous language
learning” (p. 16).
Perhaps in order to define the concept of autonomy in language learning it is necessary
to understand who au tonomous learners are. As Littlewood (1996) claims, an
autonomous learner is “one who has independent capacity to make and carry out
choices which govern his or her actions” (p. 428). The researcher argues that this
capacity depends on two major components  such as ability and willingness, and he
claims that the attributes can also be further subdivided. Thus, ability depends on
having knowledge about the options from which one can choose and skills so as to
choose the most suitable alternatives. When it com es to willingness, this depends on
having motivation and confidence in order to take responsibility for adequate choices.
Moreover, Littlewood (1996) argues that if an individual is to be successful in being
autonomous, all of these components have to be present all together.
At the close of this section, a few words are in order on the notion of autonomous
language learning. An interesting description of the concept in question is offered by
Reinders (2011), who defines autonomous language learning as “an act of learning
whereby motivated learners consciously make informed decisions about that learning”
(p. 48). According to the said researcher, it is not possible or needed in all acts of
learning to be able or ready to intentionally make decisions since di fferent learning
situations present different demands. Reinders (2011) further argues that “autonomy is
not an either-or concept, but has to be seen as a continuum” (p. 48). This is because a
learner can display more or less autonomy in different learning circumstances.
Autonomy, in Reinders’ terms changes over time between skills and within skills and
thus it is difficult to achieve and is not invariably permanent (Reinders, 2011).

2.2. Autonomy and new technologies
As stated in the previous section, the concept of autonomy has been one of the most
researched areas in the field of second/foreign language learning and teaching over the
last few decades. It should be noted, however, that the field of learner autonomy
started to be influenced by technology in the mid -1990s as a result of the growing
influence of the internet on almost every sphere of our life (including second/foreign
language education) and the opportunities for online collaboration and communication
(Reinders & White, 2016). As stated by Benson and Chik (2010), the latest generations
of new technologies, particularly those encompassing the internet, user-generated Web
content and mobility , seem to be having a bearing on the way autonomous language
learning develops. Perhaps, one of the most important benefits of implementing new
technologies into language learning is the fact that they provide occasions for language
learners who do not have direct access to the target language. This is because the use
of new technologies, including mobile technology, allow them to “bypass classrooms and
go directly to target language texts and users through the internet and social media”
(Benson, 2011, p. 17).
When it comes to the use of mobile technology, and, in particul ar, smartphones and
tablet computers, for learning a foreign or second language, they can assist language
learners with their learning endeavors by granting access to numerous language
resources whenever and wherever such learners need them and/or they hap pen to be
(Jones, 2015). In Jones’s opinion, such language involvement might comprise, for
instance, the use of chunks of spare time for language practice, search ing for target
language vocabulary in relevant contexts or interactions on social media (Jones , 2015).
Furthermore, by having a mobile device a language learner has the opportunity to take
control of his or her learning, direct it and engage in language activities that meet his or
her individual needs and goals (Kukulska -Hulme, Traxler & Pettit, 20 07; Pettit &
Kukulska-Hulme 2007).
Given the importance attached to new technologies, and, in particular the potential role
of mobile devices in autonomous language learning, the terms  mobile
learning and mobile devices (MobDs) need first to be explained. As for mobile learning,
no single agreed -upon definition of the term exists in the literature (Oz, 2015). This is
because some researchers define mobile learning as an extension of e -learning built
upon mobile devices whereas some other researchers understand  it as learning that
happens anywhere and anytime (cf. Oz, 2015). As far a s mobile devices are concerned,
they can be defined as “any device that is small, autonomous and unobtrusive enough
to accompany us in every moment and can be used for educational purposes”
(Trifanova Knapp, Ronchetti & Gamper, 2004, p. 3) or as “hand held electronic devices
that can be comfortably carried around in a pocket or bag, including MP3 players, digital
recorders, e -readers, tablets, and smartphones” (Kukulska -Hulme, Norris & Donohue,
2015, p. 39).
A lot of studies concerning the use of mobile tech nology and mobile devices in language
learning have been published. The f indings of these studies concentrated on, for
example, language learners’ views on the use of mobile devices in language instruction
(e.g. Oz, 2015), students’ attitudes towards using  mobile phones as instructional tools
for foreign language learning (e.g. Cakir, 2015), profiling mobile language learners (e.g.
Byrne & Diem, 2014), their effect on learning a foreign/second language (e.g. Nah,
White & Sussex, 2008; Cavus & Ibrahim, 2009;  Zhang, Song & Burston, 2011),
distance language learning (e.g. Demouy, Jones, Kan, Kukulska -Hulme & Eardley,
2016), informal language learning practices (Reinders & Cho, 2011; Jones, 2015),
learners’ use of mobile devices for learning a foreign language ( Stockwell, 2007;
Dashtestani, 2015) and autonomy in language learning (e.g. Díaz -Vera, 2012; Djoub,
2015). In addition to this, researchers investigated a number of applications of mobile
devices and presented both benefits and drawbacks of the usage of mo bile technologies
(e.g. Miangah & Nezarat, 2012), discussed the use of mobile devices in supporting
social contacts and collaborative learning (e.g. Kukulska -Hulme & Shield, 2008) and
offered guidelines related to the implementation of mobile learning into  second/foreign
language instruction (e.g. Kukulska-Hulme et al., 2015).

3. Method
3.1. Research question
One of the questions related to future research and practice in technology -mediated
learner autonomy addressed by Reinders and White in their recent  critical overview of
the relationship between technology and autonomy in the journal  Language Learning &
Technology (LLT)  concerned language learners engagement with technology -mediated
environments in order to develop learning experiences that reach thei r aims and meet
their needs as language learners (Reinders & White, 2016). Taking this important
matter into consideration , and in view of the fact that mobile technology, including
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers , are ubiquitous and
substantial constituents of almost every language learner’s everyday life, the
abovementioned question was modified and posed in this study in the following way:
Do students engage with their mobile devices to develop learning experienc es
(e.g. the use of mobile devices for formal and/or informal English language
study) that meet their needs and goals (e.g. the development of the target
language skills and sub-skills) as English language learners? If yes, why and how
do they do this?
3.2. Participants
The participants were 20 Polish university students of English philology, nine of whom
(seven females and two males) were in the second year of their BA programme, six
(five females and one male) in the third year and five (all females) in the second year of
their MA program (1). The study participants were on average 22.22 years old (20.66 -
year 2, BA; 21.82 - year 3, BA and 24.50 - year 2, MA). The subj ects reported having
learned English for an average of 11.38 years (10.49 - year 2, BA; 11.27 - year 3, BA
and 12.21 - year 2, MA). The proficiency level represented by the participants of the
study could be described as somewhere between B1 and B2 (second  year BA students),
B2 and C1 (third year BA students) and C1 and C2 (second year MA students), as
specified in the levels laid out in the  Common European Framework of Reference for
Languages.
3.3. Data collection and analysis
The data were gathered by means of a semi-structured interview. This interview format
was chosen intentionally since it uses a set of prepared in advance guiding questions
and prompts and interviewees are encouraged to elaborate on the problems raised
during it (Dörnyei, 2007). As Dörnyei (2007) explains, in this type of the interview “the
interviewer provides guidelines and direction (hence the ‘ -structured’ part in the name),
but is also keen to follow up interesting developments and to let the interviewee
elaborate on certain issues (hence the ‘semi-’ part)” (p. 136).
During the interview, the present researcher attempted to encourage the subjects to
describe their learning experiences concerning the use of mobile devices for English
study. This was a form of introspection where t he students were prompted to examine
their behaviors and provide a first person narrative of such experiences. All the study
participants were informed that the interview concerned the use of mobile devices for
English study and they were asked for permiss ion to be digitally recorded. In order to
obtain relevant data the following questions were asked (2):
 Do you use your mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, MP3 pl ayers,
PDAs) for learning English?
 Why do you use your mobile device(s) for learning English?
 When did you start using your mobile device(s) for learning English? Has the
use of your mobile device(s) increased or decreased since that time?
 Do you use your mobile device(s) during classes?
 Do you use your mobile device(s) more frequently in - or out-of-class English
learning?
 What mobile apps have you been using most frequently and/or recently?
 Do you use your mobile device(s) more often in relation to formal or informal
English language study?

=== PAGE BREAK ===

 Do you organize regular formal or informal mobile English language learning
sessions?
 What do you learn most frequently by means of your mobile device(s)? Why
this?
 Do you feel that thanks to the use of your mobile devic e(s) you devote more
time for learning the English language?
 As far as learning English through your mobile device(s) is concerned, do you
consider yourself as an experienced user of such device(s)?
The gathered data were subjected to qualitative and quant itative analysis. The analysis
started with partial transcription of the important parts of the data (Dörnyei, 2007) on a
computer word processor program  Microsoft Word 2016 . Then the transcribed parts of
the data were read several times in order to look f or common themes and frequently
occurring information. The recurring ideas were coded and recoded, revised and
updated. The researcher used the highlighting function of the word processor program
which allows the user to highlight the text on the transcrip t with different colors and
comments to record any observations and thematic categories recognized in the data.
The emerged categories were reviewed, compared, modified and either merged or
abandoned. It should also be noted that the obtained data were ana lyzed quantitatively.
This type of analysis involved counting the number of the interviewees’ responses and
calculating percentages.
4. Findings
A thorough analysis of the data yielded the following thematic categories:  usage of
mobile devices , reasons for  using mobile devices , resources and tools , mobile
encounters, language practiced and study performance.
4.1. Usage of mobile devices
Table 1 shows the study participants’ mobile devices (MobDs) usage descriptions. The
table demonstrates that smartphones w ere the most often used mobile devices by the
students. In addition, the numerical information in the table indicates that the
participants, on average, had been using them for English language study for about
3.80 years (minimum 2, maximum 6 years). 9 (45 %) and 11 (55%) of the subjects
started using their mobile devices at senior high school and university, respectively. It
should also be added that, with the exception of one student (i.e. S9), all the other
participants claimed to use their mobile devices  in order to learn English much more
frequently with time. Finally, more than half of the students (55%) regarded themselves
as experienced or fairly experienced users of their MobDs for English language learning;
however, 45% claimed not to be very skilful in this area.

4.2. Reasons for using mobile devices
The study participants decided on the use of their MobDs in order to learn English for
the reason that they regarded them as convenient, fast and always ready to use. In
addition, some students pointed to the fact that the use of MobDs allowed them to have
quick access to the internet and organize their own study materials and/or resources.
Illustrative examples of such opinions are provided below (3):
S10: It’s very comfortable. I can reach for my dictionary any time I want and I
don’t have to carry thick books (...) The main aspect is convenience.
S5: It’s because I can find needed information ... it’s convenient because I
always carry my smartphone and I have access  to the internet all the time (...)
At home I also use my smartphone and I don’t mind it has a small screen.
S14: My tablet lets me organize things and keep my documents in one place.
This is because studying English means having countless study materials (...) I
can store them there (...) this also gives me easier access to them (...) In
addition, my smartphone can successfully replace a traditional paper dictionary
and I don’t have to waste time in thumbing through a lot of pages to find words
I’m looking for.
4.3. Resources and tools
The analysis of the data revealed that the students made use of both online resources
and mobile apps. The most frequently used language tools were online dictionaries
(e.g. diki, ColorDict Dictionary ) and a variety of mobile  apps, such as  Google
Translate, Duolingo and Fiszkoteka. The students usually accessed these tools in order
to check, revise and learn the target language vocabulary. Two students also reported
using Voscreen and WhatsApp, i.e. mobile apps for watching vi deo and communicating
with people, respectively. It should also be noted that the interviewees pointed out
various online resources they used with the purpose of practicing reading and listening
skills (e.g.  TED, online newspapers,  YouTube), vocabulary (e. g. 6 Minute

=== PAGE BREAK ===

English, PONS, Google Translate ) and having access to language materials
(e.g. Academica). Finally, some students used their MobDs in order to read language
materials downloaded from the internet (e.g. PDF files). The following responses
illustrate some of these issues:
S5: I use apps for “index cards”, dictionaries and a variety of apps for
developing English vocabulary.
S10: I have some online friends and I talk with them in English (Do you do this
by means of instant messaging applications?) Yes, I use WhatsApp Messenger.
S15: I often read scanned book pages and pdf materials (…) I access English
vocabulary by means of online dictionaries.
S20: Fiszkoteka. I frequently use this app (...) I also listen to podcasts and I
have the app called Six minutes English in order to practice listening (...) Also
because vocabulary is used in a variety of contexts.
4.4. Mobile encounters
Thirteen (65%) interviewees claimed to use their MobDs most frequently in their leisure
time, six (30%) in the classroom a nd one student said he had used his smartphone
equally frequently in the classroom and out -of-class English study. As for the students
who used their smartphones or tablet computers in their leisure time, some of them did
it with the aim of reading English  texts, listening to audio resources, checking and
learning new vocabulary, preparing multimedia presentations and playing language
games. This is not to say, of course, that this group of learners did not use their MobDs
at all during classes; however, th e use of MobDs in this respect was only limited to
checking target language vocabulary (e.g.  S1: I use my smartphone, for example, to
check something I don’t understand (...) I installed a dictionary and I use it to find
words). When it comes to the subjects who claimed to use their MobDs  most frequently
in the classroom, they used them to check unfamiliar vocabulary and/or find words they
needed during various language activities. It is also important to note that these
students were not very willing to u se their MobDs at home in view of the fact that they
favored their home computers. For example:
S7: I use them outside of University in order to learn and practice English
vocabulary and to prepare multimedia presentations.
S13: In my free time I learn Eng lish words and phrases, listen to English
recordings and I read various texts in English.
S19: Yes, I use my smartphone and tablet for out -of-class learning but I also
use them during classes mostly to check words and collocations.
S16: I think I do this d uring practical English language classes more regularly in
the classroom than outside of it (...) In the classroom I check English words in
digital dictionaries (...) I do this to check words, spelling, or to recall some words
(...) or I use my smartphone to look for synonyms (...).
The analysis of the gathered data also demonstrated that the majority of the
interviewees (13 or 65%) were in favor of using their smartphones and/or tablet
computers for informal English learning (i.e. learning the target langu age for pleasure)
and 7 (35%) students associated the use of their MobDs with formal learning (i.e.
related to their studies). It should be noted, however, that only two interviewees
claimed to hold and somewhat organize regular mobile English language sessions:
S10: I think this is what I have talked about earlier, I mean these chats with my
friends. Perhaps we don’t chat very regularly ... we chat three times a week and
that’s it but, at the same time, it’s not sporadic because we arrange it and it
takes place pretty regularly.
S16: I often watch videos on YouTube and I do this the most often through my
smartphone.
Finally, it has to be noted that the use of mobile devices was not explicitly advised or
suggested by the interviewees’ teachers during their practical English language classes
or any other classes at the university. This is not to say, of course, that the y never

=== PAGE BREAK ===

referred their students to electronic or online resources; however, they did not ask
students to use them in classes, they did not recommend any mobile apps or design
language tasks which required  using such devices in order to solve them.
4.5. Language practiced
When asked to indicate the most frequently practiced language skills and subsystems by
means of mobile devices, all the interviewees indicated the target language vocabulary.
In addition to this, some referred to pronunciation and only a f ew students mentioned
grammar and practicing reading, listening and speaking skills. As far as practicing
English vocabulary is concerned, the subjects chose to practice it through their
smartphones and/or tables because they regarded this language subsyst em as the most
important to learn, they praised their MobDs for providing them with quick and easy
access to needed words and see the way they were used in given sentences. As was
stressed by many of the interviewees, learning English vocabulary by means o f mobile
devices also allowed them to check correct pronunciation of words (i.e. they listened to
it or paid attention to phonetic transcription of words). The following excerpts exemplify
the most typical usage of MobDs by the study participants:
S3: (…) as for vocabulary I guess it’s much faster to search for words and know
how to use them in sentences.
S6: It’s easy and it’s very easy to look for words when I need them.
S12: (…) I need vocabulary not only to communicate in English (…) when I look
for wor ds I look at contexts words are used (...) I always pay attention to
spelling and also listen to pronunciation (How about phonetic transcription of
words?) Phonetic transcription of words ... yes but not often unless audio is poor
quality or it seems to so und somehow differently ... then I make sure how a
word is pronounced and I read its phonetic transcription given there.
As mentioned earlier, only a few students resorted to their MobDs in order to practice
other language areas such as listening, reading and speaking as well as grammar. This
is because they preferred more traditional resources (e.g. grammar books), they used
other devices (e.g. laptop computers) or they regarded themselves as quite proficient in
particular language skills and thus they did  not feel the need to master them by way of
MobDs. Representative excerpts from the interviewees’ responses follow:
S3: When it comes to grammar, for me it’s more convenient to use grammar
books to learn it.
S2: (…) I’m pretty good at English grammar and l istening and I don’t have to
use my smartphone to learn these language elements.
S12: I think I’m quite good at grammar and I practice listening skills by means
of my laptop computer.
4.6. Study performance
There is evidence that the use of mobile devices became an impetus for studying
English more and learn this language more effectively and efficiently (this advantageous
effect was expressed by as many as 15 or 75% interviewees). This is because  access to
a smartphone or a tablet allows some learners  devote more time to learning English
(S1: Yes, I think so. I think I spend more time ... If I was to use traditional materials,
for example, books, I wouldn’t devote so much time to it.;  S15: It seems to me th at I
dedicate more time to learn English this way and I learn more. ), encouraged another
student to learn more (S6:  I’m more willing to use my smartphone than open a paper
dictionary.) and allowed yet another subject to learn more vocabulary (S12:  Yes,
definitely. I wouldn’t have learned these words if I hadn’t used my phone. ). Such
beneficial outcomes of the use of MobDs are best described by one of the interviewees
who said:
If I’m to say that I devote more time for learning English it’s because I can
devote more time to learning it ... in the way I compare a paper dictionary with
an online one ... for example to check one word ... If I use a traditional
dictionary it takes me longer, say three minutes, but If I use an online dictionary
it takes me, say, t en seconds (...) this way I can devote less time to looking for

=== PAGE BREAK ===

information and more on language production, on the use of English ... there is
less time used but it’s more effective. (S14)
It is also interesting to note that the use of mobile devices migh t be valuable for
kinesthetic or tactical language learners:
I think I spend more time … for me it’s much nicer and more interesting than
sitting and reading books … it’s better for me since I’m kinesthetic so it’s hard
for me to sit and read a traditional  book ... it’s because I don’t remember then
much but when I use my smartphone which is mobile I can ... I can do it while
doing other activities and this makes things easier for me. (S5)
Finally, it should be noted that 5 (25%) interviewees were not able to say whether or
not the use of mobile devices made them study the target language more effectively or
efficiently and they expressed their opinion by simply claiming that “It’s difficult to say”.
5. Discussion and conclusions
The picture that emerges from the analysis of the collected data regarding the advanced
learners' use of mobile devices for learning English is relatively encouraging. This is
because all the study participants used, at least to some extent, their mobile devices
(i.e. smartphones and /or tablet computers) in order to learn the English language
autonomously. Moreover, the positive impact of using mobile devices for English study
was acknowledged by the majority of the interviewees. Their beneficial contribution to
their English developm ent was chiefly linked with easy access to English language
resources, the opportunity to store them, comfort in using their smartphones and
tablets anywhere and anytime as well as perceived gains in English learning. The results
of the study also showed t hat all interviewees engaged with their smartphones and/or
tablet computers to practice the target language vocabulary (plus some students also
claimed to learn pronunciation of English words) and the majority of the subjects used
their mobile devices auto nomously in their leisure time as well as during language
classes. Such a state of affairs can be explained in terms of increased awareness on the
part of some students of the beneficial role of MobDs in foreign language learning, their
ability to reach fo r appropriate tools and retrieve needed information to achieve their
goals and adjust their learning of the target language to their personal learning styles.
Despite this positive view of MobDs reported by the study participants, the results of the
study also revealed that only a few subjects engaged with  their mobile devices to
master target language skills such as reading, listening, writing and speaking as well as
English language grammar. In addition, some interviewees limited themselves to a
rather intuitive and perhaps even spontaneous use of their mobile devices in the
language classroom. It should also be noted that almost half of the subjects regarded
themselves as quite inexperienced in using their mobile devices when it comes to
learning the English language despite the fact that some of the students had been using
them with t he intention of learning English for years. Taking all these findings into
account, one may conclude that this is due to a failure or underestimation of the role
and place of mobile devices in foreign language learning and teaching on the part of
language teachers. It seems therefore warranted to say that the subjects’ use of mobile
devices could be altered if teachers took into account the benefits they may offer. For
this reason language teachers should, for instance, present the affordances of mobile
technology and discuss them with students during language classes. They should also
select mobile apps and create opportunities for using them in - and out-of-class learning
by offering or designing tasks devoted to practicing a variety of language skills and
subsystems suitable for the use of such devices. If this were to happen, teachers need
to respond quickly to the constant and dynamic changes in contemporary
foreign/second language learning and teaching contexts by undergoing official teacher
training not only in the area of technology-mediated language learning and teaching but
also in the context of learner autonomy.
As with all studies , the study reported in this paper has some limitations. Although the
interviewees represented a range of experience of English language learning, the small
number of participants reduces the generalizability of the results. Another limitation is
related to the fact that the group was largely homogenous, i.e. the subjects came from
the same institution and all studied English. Yet another weakness may concern the

data collection instrument, namely the semi -structured interview which was conducted
only once. Perhaps a different set of questions, their wording or a series of such
interviews carried out over a particular period of time (say one academic year) may
have yielded more detailed and insightful results. Despite these limitations, this study
provided some insights into why and how advanced English language learners engage
with their mobile devices to develop learning experiences. It should be stressed,
however, that teacher involvement in creating conditions conducive to the use of mobile
devices for lan guage study may result in greater learner engagement with mobile
technology (i.e. mobile devices) and, at the same time, may lead to greater students’
independence in learning the target language.
